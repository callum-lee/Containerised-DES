<h2><a name="_Toc51268226">Input Builder</a></h2>

</div>

<p class=Main>The Input Builder is a tool for constructing inputs that involve
expressions.  It is opened through the Input Editor by clicking on the 'Input
Builder' entry in the dropdown menu for a keyword.</p>

<p class=Main>The following figure shows the Input Builder being used to
construct the input to the <span class=KeywordChar>RunOutputList</span> keyword
for the Simulation object.</p>

<p class=Main>The Input Builder has an auto-complete feature that provides a
menu of valid names for both objects and outputs.  The feature is activated by
entering a left square bracket (indicating the start of an object name) or a
period (indicating the start of an output name).  The menu becomes shorter as
the user enters any portion of the object's or output's name.  The highlighted
menu entry can be changed using the up and down arrow keys.  It can be selected
by pressing the 'Return' key or the 'Spacebar'.  Hovering the cursor over a
menu item generates a pop-up description of the object or output.  For an
object, the description pop-up is generated from the input to its <span
class=KeywordChar>Description</span> keyword.</p>

<p class=Main>Long expressions can be entered over multiple lines to improve
readability.  Line feeds within an expression are retained as part of the
input.</p>

<p class=Main>The input for a keyword that uses inner curly braces such as <span
class=KeywordChar>AttributeDefinitionList</span> or <span class=KeywordChar>RunOutputList</span>
can also be spread over several lines in the Input Builder.  In this case, the
line feeds between the pairs of braces are deleted automatically when the input
is accepted.  When an existing input is edited, the input for each pair of
curly braces is placed automatically on a separate line.</p>

<p class=Main>The field at the bottom of the Input Builder shows whether or not
the present input is valid.  The present value for the input is shown if the
input is valid.  An error message is shown if it is not valid.  Only a valid
input can be accepted.</p>

<p class=Main>A button bar is provided that includes all the symbols and data
types that are used by the expression system's syntax.  The buttons provide
both a convenient way to enter the correct symbols as well as pop-up
descriptions that define the syntax and provide examples.</p>
