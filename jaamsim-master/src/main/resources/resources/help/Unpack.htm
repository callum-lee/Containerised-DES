object is used to remove the entities from incoming <span class=SimObjectChar>EntityContainers</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Entities are unpacked one by one from the <span

packed.  The time to unpack each entity is specified by the <span
class=KeywordChar>ServiceTime</span> keyword.  The received <span
