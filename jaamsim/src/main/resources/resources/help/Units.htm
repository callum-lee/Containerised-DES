<h4>Units</h4>

<p class=Main>The Units entry in the menu bar is used to set the units in which
to display model outputs in the Control Panel, Output Viewer, and output
reports.  The default values in the Input Editor will also be displayed in the
selected unit.</p>

<p class=Main>For example, if you want simulation time to be displayed in
seconds instead of hours, select TimeUnit from the submenu of unit types and
click on the entry labelled 's'.  With this change, the Control Panel will
display simulation time in seconds and every output in the Output Viewer with
units of time will be displayed in seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the choice of output unit has no effect on the
internal calculations in a simulation model.  Furthermore, model inputs can
always be entered in any valid unit.</p>
