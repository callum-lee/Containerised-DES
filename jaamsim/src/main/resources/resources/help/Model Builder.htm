<h2>Model Builder</h2>

</div>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Model Builder provides
palettes of objects that can be dragged and dropped to construct a new model or
to modify an existing one.</p>

<p class=Main>Pop-up descriptions can be shown by hovering the mouse over each
object in the Model Builder.  More information can be obtained about an object
by left clicking on it and pressing F1 to launch the Help window for that
object.</p>

<p class=Main>Some objects, such as DisplayModels and Units, do not have a
graphical representation and cannot be dragged and dropped by the user.  These
objects appear in the Object Selector, but not in the Model Builder.</p>

<p class=Main>An object created by drag and drop is assigned a name by
appending a number to the name of the object type.  For example, the first
DisplayEntity that is dragged and dropped will be named DisplayEntity1.  The
second one will be named DisplayEntity2, and so on.</p>

<p class=Main>If the 'Show Labels' button is set, then an EntityLabel object
displaying the object's name will be created below the dragged and dropped
object.</p>

<p class=Main>An object can be renamed by double-clicking on the name displayed
by its EntityLabel and editing it in place.  The new name is accepted by
pressing the Enter key or by clicking elsewhere in the view window.  An object
name can be any alphanumeric text that does not include spaces, tabs, single or
double quotes, square brackets, hash characters, or periods.</p>

<p class=Main>When an entity is dragged and dropped on top of a region, the
entity's Region input is set to that region.</p>
