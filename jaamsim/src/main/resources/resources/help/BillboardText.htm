</div>

<p class=Main>A <span class=SimObjectChar>BillboardText</span> object is similar
to a <span class=SimObjectChar>Text</span> object, except that the text is
always oriented towards the <span class=SimObjectChar>View</span> window and
its height is given in pixels instead of metres.  <span class=SimObjectChar>BillboardText</span>
retains its coordinates in space and in this way differs from the <span
class=SimObjectChar>OverlayText</span> object.  Both static and dynamic text
can be displayed by a <span class=SimObjectChar>BillboardText</span> object
using the same keywords as <span class=SimObjectChar>Text</span> objects.</p>

<p class=Main><span class=SimObjectChar>BillboardText</span> is commonly used
to label 3D objects.  The advantage of using <span class=SimObjectChar>BillboardText</span>
is that the label is visible and readable from all view angles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The keywords for <span class=SimObjectChar>BillboardText</span>
are identical to those for <span class=SimObjectChar>Text</span> objects and
have the same meaning, except for the <span class=KeywordChar>TextHeight</span>
keyword, which now gives the height of the text in pixels instead of metres. 
At the present time, this input must include the units of metres (m) even
though it is interpreted as pixels.  This will be corrected in a future version
of the software.</p>
