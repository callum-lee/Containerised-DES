<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The <span class=SimObjectChar>EntityDelay</span>
object delays an incoming entity by a variable duration before passing it to
the next object.</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The delay is represented as motion
along a line that is similar in appearance to the <span class=SimObjectChar>EntityConveyor</span>
object.  It differs, however, in that the entities moving along the line can
pass one another due to their different delay times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The duration of each entity's delay is determined by the <span
class=KeywordChar>Duration</span> keyword.  This input has units of time and
accepts a constant value, a <span class=SimObjectChar>TimeSeries</span>, a Probability
Distribution, or an Expression.</p>
