<h2><a name="_Toc47541791"></a><a name="_Toc440897743">Object Selector</a></h2>

</div>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Object Selector contains all
objects that have been created for the present model, including ones that were
created automatically by JaamSim.  Objects are grouped according to their
palette and type in a tree format that mirrors the structure of the Model
Builder.  A specific object can be selected either by clicking its node in the
Object Selector or by clicking it in a <span class=SimObjectChar>View</span>
window.</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>Objects that have been created
using the Model Builder can be renamed or deleted using the Object Selector.  Once
an object has been selected, it can be renamed by pressing F2 or by left-clicking
on its highlighted entry in the Object Selector, similar to the convention in
Windows.  A selected object can be deleted by pressing the Delete key, or by
right-clicking in either a <span class=SimObjectChar>View</span> window or the
Object Selector and selecting Delete.</p>

<p class=Main>The default objects: XY-Grid, XYZ-Axis, Title, and Clock, can be
deleted by the user.  However, for the XY-Grid and XYX-Axis, it is better to
hide them using the 'Show Grid' and 'Show Axes' buttons, which allows them to
be re-instated at a later time.</p>
