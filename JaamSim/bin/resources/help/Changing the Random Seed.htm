</div>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>Each Probability Distribution has
the <span class=KeywordChar>RandomSeed</span> keyword, which generates a
different pseudo-random sequence of values for each Probability Distribution. 
Often, a simulation model is executed multiple times, called ‘replications’,
using different random seeds to determine the statistical accuracy of the
output parameters.</p>

<p class=Main>One way to achieve multiple replications is to change the <span
class=KeywordChar>RandomSeed</span> for each Probability Distribution. 
However, this can be impractical when large numbers of distributions are used
in a model.  The <span class=KeywordChar>GlobalSubstreamSeed</span> keyword for
the <span class=SimObjectChar>Simulation</span> object simplifies this
process.  Changing the input for this keyword causes all Probability
Distributions in the model to generate a different random sequence.  In effect,
the seed for each Probability Distribution is the combination of the inputs to
the <span class=KeywordChar>RandomSeed</span> and <span class=KeywordChar>GlobalSubstreamSeed</span>
keywords.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When multiple objects behave according to a Probability Distribution
with the same characteristics, it is advisable to have a unique instance of the
Probability Distribution for each object.  This avoids any cross-correlation
effects arising from the order in which a single distribution may be sampled.</p>
