<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The <span class=SimObjectChar>Release</span>
object de-allocates one or more units of a specified set of <span
class=SimObjectChar>Resources</span> on receiving an incoming entity.  All of
the <span class=SimObjectChar>Resources</span> are released simultaneously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On release of the <span class=SimObjectChar>Resources</span>,
the entities waiting for these Resources are processed in order of the priority
assigned to them by the input to their Queue’s <span class=KeywordChar>Priority</span>
keyword.  If the entities in two or more Queues have the same priority value,
then the one that has waited the longest is chosen.</p>
