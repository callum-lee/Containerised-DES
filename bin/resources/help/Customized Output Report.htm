<h2><a name="_Toc78442812">Customized Output Report</a></h2>

</div>

<p class=Main>When making multiple runs, the output reports for the runs are
appended one after another in a single file.  If more than just a few runs are
to be made, it is best to create a customized output report using the <span
class=KeywordChar>RunOutputList</span> keyword for Simulation.  This keyword
allows the user to specify the set of outputs needed to analyse the results
from the runs.  Each output is entered as a separate expression enclosed by
curly braces.  For example, if the desired outputs are the average utilisation
of Server1 and average waiting time in hours for Queue1, then the input to the <span
class=KeywordChar>RunOutputList</span> keyword would be as follows:</p>

<p class=code style='margin-left:13.5pt'>{ [Server1].Utilisation } {
[Queue1].AverageQueueTime/1[h] }</p>

<p class=Main>To make the custom output file easier to input to Excel, it is
best to record only dimensionless values such as <span class=codeChar><span
style='font-size:9.0pt'>[Queue1].AverageQueueTime/1[h]</span></span> in the
above example. In this way, the value will be converted into the desired unit
(hours in this case) and the unit will not appear in the entries for this
column.</p>

<p class=Main>Prepare this input using the Input Builder, which can be opened
from the dropdown menu in the Input Editor.</p>

<p class=Main>At the end of each run, the specified outputs are collected in a
single output file with the name &lt;configuration file name&gt;.dat.  The file
has one row for each simulation run that was performed and is tab-delimited, which
allows it to be opened in Excel for analysis.  Each row in the output file is
labelled with the scenario number and the replication number.  An extra row is
added after the runs for each scenario containing the average values and 95%
confidence intervals for each output value.</p>

<p class=Main>The <span class=KeywordChar>RunOutputList</span> report can be
generated with or without the main report, as specified by the <span
class=KeywordChar>PrintReport</span> keyword.  The keywords <span
class=KeywordChar>PrintReplications</span>, <span class=KeywordChar>PrintConfidenceIntervals</span>,
and <span class=KeywordChar>PrintRunLabels</span> allow the contents of the
output file to be customized as desired.</p>
