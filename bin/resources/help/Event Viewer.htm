<h2>Event Viewer</h2>

</div>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Event Viewer is a tool for
debugging and optimizing a simulation model.  It is intended primarily for
advanced users and programmers, but can also be used to demonstrate the
underlying logic behind discrete event simulation.</p>

<h3>Future Events tab</h3>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The 'Future Events' tab displays
the future events that are scheduled for execution by the model at the present
simulation time.  The most recent events that have been executed, including
conditional events, are also displayed along with the computer processing time
in nanoseconds that was required to execute each event.  A maximum of 1,000
completed events can be recorded, after which the oldest ones are discarded.</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>A complex model can have many
hundreds or thousands of future events.</p>

<p class=Main>Events that have been completed are shown with a green background
in the table.  An event that was scheduled and then cancelled is shown with a
red background.  A conditional event that has been completed is shown with a
yellow background.  Future events are shown with a white background.</p>

<p class=Main>The following information is provided by the columns in the
table:</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Ticks</b> – the internal simulation time for the event
expressed as an integer number of 'clock ticks'.  The duration of a clock tick
is defined by the <span class=KeywordChar>TickLength</span> input for the
Simulation object. The default value is one microsecond.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Time</b> – the simulation time for the event.  The time unit
for this display is set using the Unit menu item on the Control Panel.  The
default unit is hours.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Pri </b>– the priority of the event that was assigned by the
internal JaamSim logic.  Events that are scheduled for the same simulation time
are executed in order of increasing priority value, e.g. an event with priority
2 is executed before an event with priority 5.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Description </b>– the simulation object associated with the
event and the JaamSim method to be executed by the event.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>State</b> – the present state of the event: 'Completed',
'Terminated', or blank if the event has not been executed yet.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Nanos</b> – the computer processing time in nanoseconds that
was required to execute the event.  These times are accurate ONLY when the
model is executed continuously with 'Real Time' mode turned off.  Processing
times are many times longer when events are executed one by one using the 'Next
Event' button or when 'Real Time' mode is used to slow the execution speed for
the model.  The large reduction in processing time is due to the 'just-in-time'
compiling used by the Java virtual machine, not to the way the execution time
data is collected.</p>

<p class=Main>The following buttons are provided:</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>'Next Event' button</b> – executes the next future event.  If
the event time is later than the present simulation time, the model is advanced
to that time in accordance with the 'Real Time' mode setting, i.e. at the
specified execution speed if it is 'on' or instantaneously if it is 'off'. 
After the event is executed, it is common for one or more new events to be
scheduled for execution at future times.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>'Next Time' button</b> – executes the next future event along
with any other events that are scheduled for the same simulation time.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>'Clear Events' button</b> – removes all the completed events
from the Event Viewer.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>'Hide Condition Events' button </b>– turns off the display of
any conditional events that were executed.  Conditional events are tested and,
if appropriate, executed before time is advanced to the next event time.  The
processing time required to execute these events can be significant which makes
it important to display them.  However, if there are a large number of these
events, they can create unnecessary clutter in the display.  This button gives
the user the ability to display or hide these results as required.</p>

<h3>'Conditional Events' tab</h3>

<p class=Main>The 'Conditional Events' tab provides a list of the conditional
events to be tested and possibly executed at each event time.  Most conditional
events are associated with an <span class=SimObjectChar>ExpressionThreshold</span>
object.  Note that often it is possible to eliminate a conditional event by
providing an input to the <span class=KeywordChar>WatchList</span> keyword for
the object in question.</p>

<h3>'Execution Time Profile' tab</h3>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The 'Execution Time Profile' tab
provides a list of event types sorted by the total processing time consumed by
each event type.  </p>

<p class=Main>For accurate results, a model MUST be executed with 'Real Time'
mode set to 'off' and allowed to run long enough for the 'Speed' display on the
Control Panel to have reached its maximum value.  The model should then be
paused and the 'Clear Results' button clicked to reset the execute time data. 
The model can then be resumed to collect fresh data.  The displayed profile
data is updated continuously as the model runs.</p>

<p class=Main>The following data is displayed on the 'Execution Profile' tab:</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>'Event Type'</b> – the simulation object and JaamSim method
name for the event.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>'% of Total Time'</b> – the total processing time for the
events of this type divided by the total processing time for all types of
events, expressed as a percentage.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>'Rate' </b>– the number of executions for this event type per
unit simulation time.  The time unit for this display is set using the Unit
menu item on the Control Panel.  The default unit is hours.</p>

<p class=Main style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>'Avg. Nanos'</b> – the average processing time in nanoseconds
required to execute events of this type.</p>

<p class=Main>The 'Rate' and 'Avg. Nanos' displays can be used to determine
whether the total processing time for an event type is the result of a long
execution time or a large number of events being executed.</p>

<p class=Main>The 'Show Class Results' button changes the display to show
results for each simulation object type instead of for each simulation object. 
For example, the normal display will show separate entries for EntityConveyor1
and EntityConveyor2, whereas with 'Show Class Results' selected, it will show a
single entry for all EntityConveyors.</p>
